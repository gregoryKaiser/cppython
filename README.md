# cppython
Using assignments from Computational Engineering Physics (AEP 4380) to practice python programming.<br>

I've decided to use a jupyter notebook in order to align descriptions of results with source code directly.<br>

Project Goals: Wherever possible, create abstract methods instead of hard coded single-shot scripts. When I first completed these assignments I just whipped up whatever worked as fast as possible, so hopefully the time and freedom will help me be a slightly better programmer. Not that I really know what I'm doing. Anyway...<br>
